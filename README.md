MyToken Smart Contract
Description
MyToken is a basic Solidity smart contract for an Ethereum token. This contract includes functionality to mint and burn tokens and tracks balances for different addresses. It also stores public variables for the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply.

Features
Public Token Information: The contract has public variables for the token name, abbreviation, and total supply.
Balance Tracking: It maintains a mapping of balances for each address.
Minting Tokens: A function to create new tokens and add them to an address's balance.
Burning Tokens: A function to destroy tokens from an address's balance, with a check to ensure enough balance is available.

Getting Started
To deploy and use the MyToken smart contract, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/MyToken.git](https://github.com/Sumitraj03/eth.sol1/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)
Open in Remix IDE:

Go to Remix IDE.
Create a new file and copy-paste the code from MyToken.sol.
Compile the contract using Solidity version 0.8.18.
Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network (e.g., a testnet or local blockchain).
Interact with the Contract:

Use the mint function to add tokens to an address.
Use the burn function to reduce the token balance of an address.
Check the token details and balances using the public variables.
